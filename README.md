# The Google Homepage Project


The purpose of this project is to recreate a simple Google search home page using HTML and CSS. This project is from The Odin Project's Web Development 101 <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css">curriculum</a>.

With this being my first project, I found it difficult to move around elements and configure the layout. However, I was able to figure it out and I am satisfied with the result. I was successful in my objective of putting into practice the HTML and CSS I've been studying the past few weeks.
